 The goal is to perceive the position of a red dot in a certain period of time. After that period the red dot will look like any other dot in the grid. The difficulty can ve varied by following factors:
<ul>
    <li>gridsize (will also impact the diameter of the points)</li>
    <li>timeout-period</li>
    <li>amount of points (To-Do)</li>
    <li>Distance between red dot and center of screen (To-Do)</li>
</ul>

Planned features:
<ul>
    <li>Highscore system (different combinations of above mentioned factors should give different amount of score-points)</li>
    <li>Distinguish between creative mode (settings can be modified by the player) and highscore mode (difficulty increases with each successful round)</li>
    <li>The datapoints should be inspectable and give hints to where the red dot may have been visible.. </li>
    <li>There should be different zones where the red dot could be displayed</li>
</ul>

Smaller additions:
<ul>
    <li>Add number of attemps for correct datapoints</li>
    <li>Add control of point-amount</li>
    <li><strike>Beautify UI</strike></li>
    <li><strike>Make game playable by adding delay</strike></li>
    <li><strike>Solve bugs in point generator</strike></li>
</ul>
